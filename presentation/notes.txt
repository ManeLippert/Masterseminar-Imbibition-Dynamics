MOTIVATION - WHAT IS IMBIBITION?

- Imbibition process of everyday life
- Dunking biscuit into coffee, getting drenched with rain, drenching sugar with alcohol
- Application in nature
    -> Water reaching tips of the tallest trees
    -> Flow through soil (Dracy Law)
-Application in industry
    -> Oil recovery
    -> Chromatography (experiment in chemistry)
    -> Food processing, agriculture 
- Interplay of capillary pressure, viscous drag, volume conservation and gravity
- Evolution of invasion with universial scaling on large length and timescales 
    -> Independent of the microscopic details of the fluid and media

- In the following discussion about the Lucas Washburn Law and the influence of geometry

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THEORY - CAPILLARY FLOW

- This section about the Lucas-Washburn Law also known as BCLW Imbibition
    -> BC = Bell, Cameron (1906) find relation between length and time experimentally
    -> L = Lucas (1918) find coeffient of the relation
    -> W = Washburn (1921) theoretical derivation

    -> Concentrate on the derivation

- Explain geometry
    -> Single capillary with uniform circular cross-section r (any length and shape)
    -> Contact with the liquid at point A in depth
    -> End B open to atmosphere or closed and evacuated 

- After time t_0 and lenght l_0 velocity dropped to a value that follows the Poiseulli's Law
- Poiseulli's Law will from there on persist
- For small capillary only the Poiseulli's regime from concern 
- Poiseulli's Law (epsilon is coeffient of the slip, l length of column liquid) should be known

- After time t the meniscus will arrived at point M with velocity (dl/dt)
- Capillary cylindrical shape -> dV 
- Pressure given by 
    -> P_A atmospheric pressure (const), 
    -> P_h hydrostatic pressure (ls and psi) and 
    -> P_s capillary pressure (contact angle theta and surface tension)

- Assumption pis, theta, eps const
- Limiting only to cases with psi = 0, pi/2 -> ls = l
- Rearrangement
- Simplificate with R, P_R and C_h
- Integrate inverse of quotient dl/dt

- Look at psi = pi/2 and assumptions
    -> psi = pi/2, C_h with new value
    -> eps = 0 (true for liquids which wets the capillary) R with new value
    -> liquid moves under its own capillary pressure P_R = P_s 

- Expansion of logarithmic term (C_h l << P_R)
- Rearrangement -> Lucas-Washburn Law 
- Same result for psi = 0 
- Factor is called penetrativity (proportionalities)
- Rate of penetration (proportionalities)
- Amount of Liquid entered in porous media
    -> Small capillaries with different radius but small enough
    -> Volume equation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THEORY - GEOMETRY 

- Based on Reyssat and only concentrate on the 3D case
- One-Dimensional flow in z-Direction 
- Using classical Darcy description with Darcy Law (Experimental Law from Henry Darcy)
    -> averaged velocity u 
    -> permeability k (ability of material to transmit fluid) depending on shape of the cross-section
- From Mass conservation follows Volumetric Flow Q 
- Pressure P_0 with (P_A and P_h) and P_s with c parameter depending local geometry and contact angle theta
- Integrate from z = 0 (P = P_0) to z = l (P = P_0 - P_s) and Rearrangements
- Substitute Q with velocity of the meniscus at position l with known equation but on position l (r(l))
- General imbibition equation for invasion into structured solid in 3D

- Use Power-Law to describe capillary structure
- Assume c(l) is approximately const since cosine is bounded
- Dimensionaless Parameter
- Dimensionaless Equation

- Case n = 0 -> Lucas Washburn Law
- Case n >= 1 
    -> Short times L << 1 -> Bracket = 1, Integral = L 
        -> L ~T^1/2
    -> Long times  L >> 1 -> Bracket = L^n, Integral = Integral to infinity = const for n > 1/4 
        -> L ~T^1/(3n+1)
- Show Graphic of Solution
- Cross-Over between this two limits at L = 1
- Second regime depends on parameter n 
    -> The more diverging the geometry, the slower the dynamics become at long times

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPERIMENTS

- Experiments with sugar since the subject is the Feuerzangenbowle
    -> Water (blue) video slowed down 1s = 0.125s
    -> Glycerin (green, more viscous) video sped up 1s = 30s
- Experiment with filter paper (Inspiration from Dullien which was mentioned in Reyssat study)
    -> Put coffee filter paper in contact with water
    -> l = t^1/2 lit bit visible
    -> Repeat experiment multiple times and get Lucas-Washburn Law (with substraction of offset (explain?))
- Life Experiment with big sugar cone (?)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION

- Imbibition is an important process in nature and industry
- Capillary-driven Imbibition discribed by Lucas-Washburn Law
- Geometry with two regimes at short and long times
- More diverging, slower the dynamics at long times
- Simple experiment with coffee filter paper proofs Lucas-Washburn Law

APPENDIX

- 2D geometry imbibition
    -> Volumetric rate and permeability changes
    -> r power goes down by one digit
    -> Short time regime still the same
    -> Long time regime decrement the factor before n
    -> Rest the same

- Why c(l) is constant?
    -> Lubrication theory (wetting of capillary) requires dr/dz << 1 for n > 1
    -> arctan simplfy
    -> cos can be expanded for wetting case theta << 1
    -> c = const for factor << 1
    -> Additional dependency between r_0, alpha and n

- Experiments with Vycor Glass
    -> Vycor Glass = silica substrate with an interconnected network of nanometer-sized, elongated pores 
    -> H(t) mean height
    -> w(t) distance between H(t) and maximal invasion front
    -> Lucas-Washburn Law still applies

- Outtakes
